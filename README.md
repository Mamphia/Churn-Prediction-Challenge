# Churn-Prediction-Challenge
# Introduction

Subscription services are leveraged by companies across many industries, from fitness to video streaming to retail. One of the primary objectives of companies with subscription services is to decrease churn and ensure that users are retained as subscribers. In order to do this efficiently and systematically, many companies employ machine learning to predict which users are at the highest risk of churn, so that proper interventions can be effectively deployed to the right audience.

In this challenge, I predict churn for a group of subscribers on a video streaming service! Building a model that can predict which existing subscribers will continue their subscriptions for another month. The dataset is a sample of subscriptions initiated in 2021, all snapshotted at a particular date before the subscription was canceled. Subscription cancellation can happen for a multitude of reasons, including:

   .The customer completes all content they were interested in, and no longer needs the subscription
   
   .The customer finds themselves to be too busy and cancels their subscription until a later time
   
   .The customer determines that the streaming service is not the best fit for them, so they cancel and look for something better suited
